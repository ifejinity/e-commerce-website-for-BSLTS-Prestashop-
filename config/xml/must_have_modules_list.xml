You know that this selection is appropriate and that it will appeal to your customers.&nbsp;Or you could even use your best-sellers, by adding them to those that are less visible, to allow your customers to discover them.&nbsp;Your packs will need to be made up of 2 products minimum, the number is unlimited.Push the quantity per product, choose the combinations of your choice, there are multiple options allowing you to multiply the possibilities.&nbsp;Would you like to reserve the purchase of a product within a pack?That is also possible! You will therefore be able&nbsp;to offer a free product&nbsp;if it is purchased as part of a pack. The possibilities are infinite!&nbsp;Integrated assistant&nbsp;It isn't always obvious deciding which products should be offered within a pack. Here again&nbsp;Advanced Pack&nbsp;has the solution to the problem.When creating your pack, our module will supply you with strategic information, like the number of products sold or their available stock.&nbsp;There is also an integrated&nbsp;dynamic price simulator&nbsp;for your pack, to help you see more clearly when creating your business operation.&nbsp;Remain the maestro of combinations&nbsp;One of the products that you have added to your pack is available in several colors, but you don't want to offer them all in this set?Advanced Pack&nbsp;will allow you to do this.&nbsp;You will also have the possibility of predefining a combination by default, for each of the products of your pack, even if it's different to the one defined in your catalog.&nbsp;Your customers will then be able to&nbsp;personalise their selection&nbsp;amongst the characteristics that you will have chosen to integrate in the offer.&nbsp;Business Incentive&nbsp;Incentive is something that motivates your visitor to make a purchase The main aim is to convince more of your site visitors to finish their order and/or&nbsp;spend more money per transaction.Perhaps you have already tried, by offering free delivery over a certain amount of purchases, or to offer discounts on certain products or even to send discount vouchers?All of these methods work, but their range is limited, as these promotions are usually temporary due to their excessive cost!Stop looking, you have already found the solution !&nbsp;To entice your customers,&nbsp;Advanced Pack&nbsp;will give you the choice of applying a discount when all the products in the shopping cart are ordered, thus encouraging the purchase of the whole pack.&nbsp;3 possibilities are available:&nbsp;Offer a specific discount on&nbsp;each product&nbsp;in the packApply a general discount on&nbsp;the set of productsApply a&nbsp;fixed price, such as a psychological price, for example&nbsp;Advanced Pack&nbsp;will also be able to manage the discounts already applied to your products, allowing you to integrate them in the pack price, or on the contrary, to exclude them, in order to choose the predefined discount on the pack.This decision will be made even easier thanks to our&nbsp;clear and clean-looking interface, that will allow you to see the discounted products very easily.&nbsp;You won't need to worry about the coherence of your prices anymore&nbsp;Have you ever had to review all the prices in your catalog, to detect any possible incoherences and correct them? What would happen if you had to manually manage the repercussions of these changes in product pricing in your packs? This would represent a significant extra workload if if it's not anticipated within the choice of management solutions within your packs!&nbsp;Once again&nbsp;Advanced Pack&nbsp;has the solution.&nbsp;By default, in the case where no reduction has been applied, the pack price is the sum of the products making it up.Should you need to modify the price of a product after having created the pack,&nbsp;the pack price will automatically be updated, and without you having to intervene.&nbsp;In those cases where you will apply a discount to one or more products in an existing pack, and on condition you have authorized the&nbsp;promotional implications, the pack price will also be changed, showing your customers the discount that has been applied.&nbsp;Is one of the products of your pack subject to an green-tax? No problem, it will automatically be reflected in the pack price and will be clearly stated, guaranteeing absolute&nbsp;respect for the legislation.&nbsp;Regarding the management of your stock, everything has been automated!&nbsp;For each pack ordered, the product stocks it contains will be&nbsp;automatically deducted. This way you will avoid the double management of stock or the frustration generated by sales rendered impossible, due to the bad assignation of quantities.Also, in the case where a product in a pack is out of stock, it will&nbsp;automatically be displayed as unavailable&nbsp;for purchase thanks to an availability warning system that is both elegant and modern.&nbsp;For your customers, we have integrated a graphic and fun notification system, allowing the instant identification of stock shortages on combinations or products making up the pack.&nbsp;There's no chance of you receiving orders for products that are out of stock !&nbsp;Highlight your packs and sell more&nbsp;Once you have defined your pack, you will be able to configure it in the same way as you would a classic product. Everything is possible, such as assigning it customized images, classing it in the category of your choice,&nbsp;optimizing your SEO, writing a customized description, attributing it an EAN code or a specific reference, configuring its volume to calculate delivery costs, etc...&nbsp;For those that are pressed for time, and in order to facilitate their marketing,&nbsp;Advanced Pack&nbsp;will automatically display all the photos of the products that make it up, as well as their descriptions, in the form of tabs.Your customers will be correctly informed, without leaving the page of your pack, and&nbsp;able to finalise their purchase in one click.&nbsp;And that's not all... For more visibility, your packs will automatically be&nbsp;highlighted on their data sheets&nbsp;for those being sold in lotsThis way, you will encourage your customers to order the pack, rather than the product they were initially interested in. Essentially, this is&nbsp;cross-selling: an accessible method of&nbsp;increasing your average shopping cart&nbsp;!&nbsp;We don't forget designers&nbsp;From the beginning, we have integrated the fact that this module should be easily adapted by your web agency or designer/integrator.  The module fits perfectly with the default PrestaShop 1.7 theme, while allowing the most advanced graphic customization.&nbsp;A set of JavaScript templates and CSS style sheets are delivered as models with the module,&nbsp;to facilitate the integration process. Either yourself or your integrator will therefore be able to use all of the functionalities of the&nbsp;Advanced Pack 5&nbsp;engine, in order to present them in the graphic form that will best correspond with the general atmosphere of your online store.]]></additional_description><tab><![CDATA[merchandizing]]></tab><version><![CDATA[5.2.18]]></version><compatibility><from><![CDATA[1.7.4.0]]></from><to><![CDATA[1.7.8.3]]></to></compatibility><price><EUR><![CDATA[279.99]]></EUR><USD><![CDATA[307.99]]></USD><GBP><![CDATA[248.99]]></GBP></price><badges><badge label="Modules Partner Creator"><![CDATA[https://medias2.prestastore.com/themes/prestastore/img/front/sprites/badges/module-editor.png]]></badge></badges><cover><small><![CDATA[https://addons.prestashop.com/616235-pprod/advanced-pack-5-create-bundles-of-products.jpg]]></small><big><![CDATA[https://addons.prestashop.com/616235-pbig/advanced-pack-5-create-bundles-of-products.jpg]]></big></cover></module><module><id><![CDATA[1768]]></id><name><![CDATA[gmerchantcenter]]></name><displayName><![CDATA[Google Merchant Center (Google-Shopping)]]></displayName><categoryName><![CDATA[Price Comparison]]></categoryName><description><![CDATA[Export your products on Google Merchant Center to display them on Google Shopping, Google Search, Google Image, the Display network (YouTube, Gmail,&hellip;) and Google partner sites!]]></description><author><![CDATA[Business Tech]]></author><url><![CDATA[https://addons.prestashop.com/en/price-comparison/1768-google-merchant-center-google-shopping.html?utm_source=back-office&utm_medium=push-addons&utm_campaign=back-office-EN&utm_content=download]]></url><img><![CDATA[https://medias1.prestastore.com/img/pico/1768.jpg]]></img><description_full><![CDATA[Export your products on Google Merchant Center to display them on Google Shopping, Google Search, Google Image, the Display network (YouTube, Gmail,&hellip;) and Google partner sites!]]></description_full><additional_description><![CDATA[Showcase your products on&nbsp;all the channels of Google Ads Shopping campaigns&nbsp;and develop your visibility without further delay.

PRESENTATION Set up&nbsp;a complete and customized customer review collection system&nbsp;on your PrestaShop store! Shop Product Reviews allows you to collect your customers' opinions&nbsp;about your products&nbsp;but also&nbsp;about their general shopping experience on your shop.&nbsp;Do you want to know their opinion on specific points? Define&nbsp;your own rating criteria,&nbsp;either for your products or your shop. You want to import your old reviews to keep your history? No problem, the module offers a simple and intuitive import/export tool! Our module&nbsp;respects the GDPR&nbsp;and&nbsp;all the European directives in force&nbsp;(such as the decree n° 2017-1436, or the directive (EU) 2019/2161) concerning the information obligations related to online consumer reviews, by putting in place everything necessary for the customer to be informed in a clear and precise way about the review management system. It allows you to display a "Verified Purchase" badge to certify that the review is a result of an order, and only customers who have an account can review your products and your shop. INCREASE YOUR CONVERSION RATE AND YOUR REVENUE 88% of Internet users&nbsp;consult customer reviews before making a purchase on an e-commerce site and&nbsp;91% of 18-25 year olds&nbsp;give as much importance to reviews on the Internet as to those of their relatives. By displaying customer reviews of your products and/or your store on your website, you&nbsp;increase your customers' trust&nbsp;in your brand. Customer reviews are a social proof of your store's reliability and play the role of a digital word of mouth. The importance of customer reviews in the e-commerce world is well known: they are now&nbsp;a key element in the decision-making process and in your marketing strategy. Moreover, customer reviews are a great free advertising tool and a way to get relevant, recent and regularly renewed content. This UGC (User Generated Content) is one of the main criteria examined by Google to improve your SEO. If your theme is properly tagged, Google will be able to show the stars corresponding to the average rating of the products in its natural results which will also improve&nbsp;your visibility, your click rate and your traffic. Our&nbsp;"Shop Product Reviews"&nbsp;module is much more than a simple review collection module. With its multiple features and options for displaying reviews, whether on product pages or list pages, through dedicated blocks or badges, our&nbsp;"Shop Product Reviews"&nbsp;module allows you&nbsp;to reassure your customers, reduce shopping cart abandonment and increase your conversion rate.&nbsp;According to a study, from the first review posted on a product, the conversion rate increases by 10%, then 30% after 50 reviews, and up to more than 44% with 200 reviews! So don't hesitate! COLLECT REVIEWS ON YOUR PRODUCTS, YOUR SHOP OR BOTH! The ""Shop Product Reviews"" module&nbsp;allows you to activate&nbsp;independently&nbsp;the collection of product reviews and the collection of reviews on your store in general. For each review system, many options are available: activation of moderation, display of reviews only in the current language, activation of a voting system, display of a "latest reviews" block, etc... The product ratings will be displayed as stars. You have the ability to customize the color of the stars to fit your theme as there are an infinite number of colors available.&nbsp;A "Verified Purchase" badge&nbsp;can be displayed next to the reviews that result from an order, to&nbsp;further reinforce the confidence of future buyers.&nbsp;The color of the badge is also fully customizable as well as its text. Whether it is for product or shop reviews,&nbsp;a system of precise scheduling of the sending of rating request e-mails is available.&nbsp;You also have the possibility to send a reminder if your customer has not given a review following the first e-mail. The titles and texts of the e-mails&nbsp;can be configured&nbsp;directly through the module, for each language of your store. Product reviews Give the possibility to evaluate a product to all registered customers or only to customers who ordered the product. The latter option makes it possible to further increase the reliability of customer feedback on your products. Enjoy flexible positioning on product pages: Display your reviews either in the footer or within a tab (if your theme supports page tabs), and decide where to position the average product rating. Also decide to display the average product rating on list pages. Allow your visitors to filter the reviews by rating and sort them as they want. Show them the distribution of the number of reviews by rating and allow them to get a quick and global idea of the reviews on a product, by enabling the display of a "battle" block showing the best review and the most critical one opposite each other. Also note that by implementing product reviews, the average rating can appear in Google's natural results as stars,&nbsp;which will attract attention and increase your visibility.&nbsp;Links that display a product rating have&nbsp;a click-through rate (CTR) between 15 and 30% higher. Shop reviews Why not also collect feedback from your customers about their overall shopping experience?&nbsp;Activate shop reviews&nbsp;and allow your customers to share their feelings about their experience on your site, the choice offered, the offers or even the ease of payment and delivery! This will strengthen the bond you have with them by showing them that you are listening to their needs and will contribute to&nbsp;increase loyalty. Place the link to the shop review form wherever you want on your website: customer account, product pages, menu, ... The module also allows you to display a "shop review" badge with the average rating given by your customers to your store, on the pages of your site while choosing its position and color. CREATE YOUR OWN CUSTOM CRITERIA Do you want to know what your customers think about particular points? Create your own rating criteria!&nbsp;Whether it is for products or the store,&nbsp;the module offers you the possibility to create personalized criteria. You decide how the criteria are worded and whether you want to reserve them for certain products or categories! Use the product rating criteria to ask your customers to rate specific characteristics of certain items in order to validate or not your choice of products or suppliers: fabric quality, price, fit of a garment, sturdiness etc... It is&nbsp;a free&nbsp;way to know the efficiency of your catalog and&nbsp;a precious help&nbsp;to make informed decisions about your products. As for the rating criteria for your shop in general, you also have the choice: navigation, site ergonomics, variety of products, clarity of descriptions, ease of payment, or even choice of delivery points! The feedback from your customers will allow you&nbsp;to make the right choices and get a better customer satisfaction rate. Not to mention the SEO benefit of the criteria!&nbsp;If you guide customers by asking them to give feedback on specific topics through the rating criteria, your customers will tend to use specific keywords that will boost your SEO on certain queries. ENCOURAGE CUSTOMERS TO POST A REVIEW BY OFFERING THEM A VOUCHER Your customers sometimes need a little help! Encourage them to leave their opinion on the products they bought, or about your shop, by offering them a voucher in exchange! This will encourage them&nbsp;to come back to place an order on your online store and will increase their loyalty. Once your offer is configured within the module, it will be displayed in the rating invitation e-mails and also in the product or shop rating forms. RIGHT TO REPLY TO BAD REVIEWS t's never easy to receive negative reviews. However, it can be an excellent opportunity to show that you are listening to your customers.

PrestaShop Pretty URL module removes automatically generated IDs and numbers from the URLs so that they could become friendly not only to users but also to search engines for better ranking. Prestashop Pretty URL Module automatically removes all the default URL ids to better optimize them for search engines. This not only positively affects your rankings but at the same time also enhances the user experience. Mostly dynamically generated URLs are meaningless, irrelevant, uninformative, and have less potential for higher ranks in search results. For that reason, the PrestaShop Search Friendly Pretty URL module cleans the URLs and make them more user as well as search engine friendly.  Rather than using irrelevant characters in addresses like www.domain.com/1-product-A, the add-on cleans the URL and adds the name of the product & service that is offered through the page like www.domain.com/product-A. Our Prestashop Pretty URL Module is one of the highest-rated and most downloaded module on Prestashop Addons. Which on one hand shows the reliability of Pretty URLs and on the other hand shows that you can use it without facing any compatibility issues.    ]]></additional_description><tab><![CDATA[seo]]></tab><version><![CDATA[2.2.7]]></version><compatibility><from><![CDATA[1.6.0.5]]></from><to><![CDATA[1.7.8.7]]></to></compatibility><price><EUR><![CDATA[69.99]]></EUR><USD><![CDATA[79.99]]></USD><GBP><![CDATA[62.99]]></GBP></price><badges><badge label="Modules Partner Creator"><![CDATA[https://medias2.prestastore.com/themes/prestastore/img/front/sprites/badges/module-editor.png]]></badge></badges><cover><small><![CDATA[https://addons.prestashop.com/1333111-pprod/pretty-urls-seo-friendly-url-remove-ids-numbers.jpg]]></small><big><![CDATA[https://addons.prestashop.com/1333111-pbig/pretty-urls-seo-friendly-url-remove-ids-numbers.jpg]]></big></cover></module><module><id><![CDATA[16939]]></id><name><![CDATA[seoexpert]]></name><displayName><![CDATA[SEO Expert]]></displayName><categoryName><![CDATA[SEO]]></categoryName><description><![CDATA[Increase site traffic by optimizing the position of your website on search engine results!

Increases Conversion RatePrestaShop One Step Checkout enhances the user experience and boosts your conversions. The flawless and user-friendly One Page Checkout ensures that shoppers do not find a troublesome experience on the checkout page and can make a purchase comfortably. Increases Average Order ValueThe latest update of the One Page Checkout module helps merchants to increase the average order value. Wondering how? Well, you can now place a free shipping banner on the checkout page which displays how much more does a user needs to shop for, to be eligible for free shipping. It is displayed as a progress bar. Build a Community of Businesses and Individual CustomersWith the use of PrestaShop One Page Checkout on your store, you will be able to form groups and communities of business and individual(customer) profiles. This way you can promote your product and run deals separately. Marketing campaigns will become more focused after the addition of this new feature.  What’s New: Custom Profile Type field: The admin can add a drop-down menu or radio buttons for users to choose their profile type. Create profile types like:BusinessClientIndividual Show total price: Admin can show the total prices with tax, without tax or both. Custom fields: The admin can enable the option to show the custom fields in the invoice.   Validation for CIF/DNI/NIF: The store owner can now enable validation for CIF/DNI/NIF on the checkout page of his store.  Abandoned Checkout Statistics: In the configuration tabs, there is one newly added feature i.e. Abandoned checkout statistics through which the admin gets an in-depth analysis of the abandoned cart details as well as the order details.

Increase customer trust and sales while reducing date-related support requests. Show your customers the estimated delivery date, from basic to elaborate configurations, on the product page, order process, and emails.]]></description_full><additional_description><![CDATA[The importance of delivery dates cannot be overstated, particularly for customers eager to spend their money in your store. This module assists you in assisting your consumers by providing features that make the overall purchasing experience of your customers easy and efficient. When shopping online, you probably have found yourself wanting to know when a product will arrive more than once. There might be several reasons for this, such as that you need the product by a specific date or are eager to receive it... In all of these cases, knowing the estimated delivery date of the product can influence your purchasing decision by increasing your trust in that shop and making you more comfortable and secure in making the purchase. From the owner’s perspective, once configured, you will see a drop in all support inquiries relating to delivery dates (this has been verified by our clients numerous times) and an increase in the sales, making the investment completely worthwhile. Internally, the module always attempts to separate its configurations into two modes: basic and advanced, making it possible to configure the module in 5 minutes while still allowing for complex configurations for those shops that require precise setups. This is possible because the module’s features handle the preparation and delivery process as if it were real life. To help you understand how it works, we've presented some of the features you’ll find particularly helpful. Geolocation: The module uses unregistered users' geolocation to determine which carriers should be displayed for that customer. The customer's stored addresses will be used after they've logged in. Display modes and customization: Without editing a single line of code, a broad range of choices are available to simply define each parameter, such as style, time format, location, and colour of the Estimated Delivery information box.Carrier-based configurations: You can set all carrier parameters globally or individually for each carrier with the advanced options.Global settings: Date modification using global parameters such as categories, manufacturers, or suppliers Product-based configurations: When configured, they override the general settings, enabling you to change the delivery time of your items by utilizing the module's unique characteristics (picking days, out-of-stock additional days, release dates, available dates...). This can be accomplished at the product or combination level. Orders and emails:The Estimated Delivery date option can also be enabled during the order process. The date can be displayed optionally on the summary, in the carrier selection phase, and finally on the order confirmation page. When this functionality is enabled, clients and administrators may check the delivery date from the order history at any time.Following the placement of the order, the delivery date can be included in the shop emails by adding a special variable on the templates. Orders by picking (pickup dates):A visual guide for determining which orders should be prioritized to meet the projected delivery dates generated at the time of the order.]]></additional_description><tab><![CDATA[shipping_logistics]]></tab><version><![CDATA[3.7.0]]></version><compatibility><from><![CDATA[1.5.0.0]]></from><to><![CDATA[1.7.8.7]]></to></compatibility><price><EUR><![CDATA[83.99]]></EUR><USD><![CDATA[94.99]]></USD><GBP><![CDATA[75.99]]></GBP></price><badges><badge label="Modules Partner Creator"><![CDATA[https://medias2.prestastore.com/themes/prestastore/img/front/sprites/badges/module-editor.png]]></badge></badges><cover><small><![CDATA[https://addons.prestashop.com/743803-pprod/estimated-delivery-date-v3-smart-modules.jpg]]></small><big><![CDATA[https://addons.prestashop.com/743803-pbig/estimated-delivery-date-v3-smart-modules.jpg]]></big></cover></module><module><id><![CDATA[19126]]></id><name><![CDATA[iqitmegamenu]]></name><displayName><![CDATA[Horizontal and vertical mega menu (navigation dropdown)]]></displayName><categoryName><![CDATA[Menu]]></categoryName><description><![CDATA[The most advanced responsive mega menu Prestashop module.&nbsp; By using Drag&amp;Drop builder you can easily create horizontal or/and vertical dropdown navigation, and responsive mobile menu]]></description><author><![CDATA[Community developer]]></author><url><![CDATA[https://addons.prestashop.com/en/menu/19126-horizontal-and-vertical-mega-menu-navigation-dropdown.html?utm_source=back-office&utm_medium=push-addons&utm_campaign=back-office-EN&utm_content=download]]></url><img><![CDATA[https://medias1.prestastore.com/img/pico/19126.jpg]]></img><description_full><![CDATA[The most advanced responsive mega menu Prestashop module.&nbsp; By using Drag&amp;Drop builder you can easily create horizontal or/and vertical dropdown navigation, and responsive mobile menu. &nbsp;]]></description_full><additional_description><![CDATA[IQITMEGAMENU is highly customizable responsive menu module.&nbsp;  Vertical and horizontal menu With our module you can get both navigations inside only one package.

Discover Dynamic Ads + Pixel.]]></description_full><additional_description><![CDATA[Best module for Facebook and Instagram, elected "Agencies' choice" and winner of two PrestaShop awards, Facebook Dynamic Ads + Pixel already has more than 10,000 downloads! Our team of experts in social networks for over 10 years, accompanies you with a complete documentation and a great responsiveness to support. EXPORT A HIGH QUALITY PRODUCT FEED ON FACEBOOK The "Dynamic Ads + Pixel" module allows you to configure your data feed in an extremely simple and fast way by including only the products and information you want. The advanced exclusion rules system gives you the freedom to create an optimized feed by excluding certain products from your ads. The advanced assignment of custom labels to your products further increases the customization of your data feed and allows you to increase the segmentation possibilities of your catalog. Product feeds generated and imported in the Facebook Business Manager will allow you: to automatically populate and keep updated&nbsp;the Shop of your Facebook Page and Instagram business profileto run&nbsp;product ads&nbsp;on&nbsp;Facebook and Instagram&nbsp;to highly targeted audiencesto show Facebook and Instagram users&nbsp;location-specific data&nbsp;(information translated into their language, prices, availability, shipping costs etc... tailored to their location) through&nbsp;country feedsto tag your products&nbsp;in your&nbsp;Facebook and Instagram&nbsp;publications or stories TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE WORLD'S MOST ADVANCED ADVERTISING TECHNOLOGY Thanks to countless personal information collected on its network, each more accurate than the others, Facebook has&nbsp;a powerful advertising targeting tool&nbsp;on which Google can not compete. On the Business Manager interface you have a multitude of options allowing you to create your advertising audiences according to age, sex, family situation, geographical location, interests, groups, liked pages and any other information that Facebook has about its users. By installing a tracking tag (Facebook pixel) on your site pages, our module allows you to&nbsp;further&nbsp;enhance these audiences. Indeed, this pixel allows you to create audiences based on&nbsp;your visitor activity (purchases, products seen, carts,...). It also allows you to enjoy the indisputable efficiency of&nbsp;dynamic retargeting. Thus, you can for example to launch ad campaigns that will automatically display to Facebook users, the products they previously viewed on your site, or relevant product recommandations. Business Manager tools will then allow you to analyse the efficiency of these ads (conversion tracking). For an even more accurate analysis of the effectiveness of your ads and an even better tracking of the buying journey, activate the conversions API in addition to the Pixel to send the data directly from your store's server! The power of Facebook also allows you&nbsp;to acquire new customers&nbsp;by attracting people whose interests are close to your current customers. Indeed, the personal information of the social network users, own by Facebook, is compared to the one of your existing customers. You can therefore display your products to these audiences, which are similar to your clientele. OFFER A LOCALIZED VERSION OF YOUR ADS AND YOUR FACEBOOK SHOP Our module allows you to use&nbsp;Facebook's country feeds&nbsp;to offer multi-country and multi-lingual Facebook and Instagram users&nbsp;a Shop and ads adapted to their location.&nbsp;For example, a Facebook user in the US will see your product data in English and prices in dollars in your Facebook Store, while a French user will see the same information in French and Euros.

Especially if you want to import products from XML/JSON files, you must check your file on the demo in order to make sure it will work as you expected, because XML/JSON files don't have specific structure as it has unlimited depth of nesting and extreme flexibility of structure.&nbsp;BENEFITS FOR MERCHANTSEasily import products and combinations from CSV, EXCEL ( XLS/XLSX), XML, JSON, TXT files.Just upload your import file and match columns with the right product properties and enjoy flawless bulk import of your data.Regardless of the size of your import file, the module will import all data without any timeout issues.Server timeout problem is resolved by using AJAX and importing data in portions.You can configure CRON Job to import data from any accessible location, for example, URL, File Path, FTP, SFTP.You can update products by Reference, ID, EAN, Supplier Reference, MPN.The module provides many options to configure it according to your needs.You can see progress of import by CRON right in the module page.You can track import history in the “Import Logs” page which provides many useful information about your imports.&nbsp; EASY IMPORT IN 3 STEPS Step 1: Import Rule SettingsWhen you start a new import, you will have a list of settings to select for your import. These settings are called "Import Rule" and they are saved so that you will not have to select them every time you want to import.&nbsp; Step 2: MappingIn this second step, you will match the columns of the import file with the corresponding properties of products/combinations. You can choose the option “Ignore this column” if you want to skip it.&nbsp;The first row of your import file is usually a header which displays column names. If it is different in your file, you can select the header row on this page at the top-right corner. For example, if you do not have header titles in your file, you should make this “header row” 0.There is a select box on the left which is used to select columns from your import file. Also, there is an input field next to each select box. In these input fields, you can enter custom values that will be applied to all products. It will be used if the value is missing in the import file or if it is empty. Step 3: ImportAfter you finish matching the columns, you can start the actual import process. It may take from several minutes to several hours to finish the process, depending on how large your import file is. Data is imported in portions so you will not have timeout issues from the server. If you have enabled CRON for the import rule in the first step, you will see instructions for configuring CRON in this 3rd step.

The PrestaShop Aliexpress Dropshipping module basically offers merchants the to import products and their combinations from AliExpress into his/her PrestaShop store. After that, they can start selling those products to the customers of the store. As there is no obligation to hold inventory so there is no limit to the number of products they can import from AliExpress. Once the merchant receives an order on the PrestaShop, the automatic ordering process helps them to place the order on Aliexpress with a single click. In order to import the product from AliExpress to PrestaShop, a chrome extension is needed. Follow the link to download the extension: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/prestashop-aliexpress-imp/iochebggflimfedlldfjjomnkpoikknk?utm_source=chrome-app-launcher-info-dialog Update Products As you have imported products from AliExpress, it might happen that some product details get updated on AliExpress afterwards. This may arise issues as your customers would treat it as a discrepancy. And, if there is a difference in price then your customer might decide to not buy from your store. So, use the automatic cron settings of the module to automatically apply all the updates on your PrestaShop store too at a set interval.]]></additional_description><tab><![CDATA[shipping_logistics]]></tab><version><![CDATA[5.4.1]]></version><compatibility><from><![CDATA[1.7.0.0]]></from><to><![CDATA[1.7.8.7]]></to></compatibility><price><EUR><![CDATA[69.99]]></EUR><USD><![CDATA[79.99]]></USD><GBP><![CDATA[62.99]]></GBP></price><badges><badge label="Modules Partner Creator"><![CDATA[https://medias2.prestastore.com/themes/prestastore/img/front/sprites/badges/module-editor.png]]></badge></badges><cover><small><![CDATA[https://addons.prestashop.com/1480730-pprod/aliexpress-dropshipping-product-importer.jpg]]></small><big><![CDATA[https://addons.prestashop.com/1480730-pbig/aliexpress-dropshipping-product-importer.jpg]]></big></cover></module><module><id><![CDATA[30523]]></id><name><![CDATA[massactions]]></name><displayName><![CDATA[Advanced Bulk / Mass Actions for Products]]></displayName><categoryName><![CDATA[Fast & Mass Update]]></categoryName><description><![CDATA[Streamline your PrestaShop in an instant with mass product edits and bulk listing updates and take the hard work out of growing your online business]]></description><author><![CDATA[ZLab Solutions]]></author><url><![CDATA[https://addons.prestashop.com/en/fast-mass-updates/30523-advanced-bulk-mass-actions-for-products.html?utm_source=back-office&utm_medium=push-addons&utm_campaign=back-office-EN&utm_content=download]]></url><img><![CDATA[https://medias1.prestastore.com/img/pico/30523.jpg]]></img><description_full><![CDATA[Streamline your PrestaShop in an instant with mass product edits and bulk listing updates and take the hard work out of growing your online business.
